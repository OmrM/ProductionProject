# Production Project
 Production Line Tracker with a GUI and database. This is a project for my Object Oriented Programming course COP3003. It allows a user to record products and keeps a log of all items added to the database. Each product must have a name,  manufacturer name, and a type. It uses JavaFX for the gui and an H2 database to record products and a production record.
